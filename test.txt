H keys are a way to identify trusted computers, without involving passwords. The steps below will walk you through generating an SSH key and then adding the public key to your GitHub account.

Tip: We recommend that you regularly review your SSH keys list and revoke any that haven't been used in a while.
Step 1: Check for SSH keys

First, we need to check for existing SSH keys on your computer. Open up your Git Bash and type:

ls -al ~/.ssh
# Lists the files in your .ssh directory, if they exist
Check the directory listing to see if you already have a public SSH key. The default public key file names are:

id_dsa.pub
id_ecdsa.pub
id_ed25519.pub
id_rsa.pub


asdfasdfasdfa
sdf
adf
